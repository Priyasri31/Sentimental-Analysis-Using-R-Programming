1,"Absolutely gorgeous ring I love it. 	You dont really have to size it is adjustable but not in a cheesey flimsy way  its well made and looks just like the picture."
2,Looks and feels like a more expensive ring. I purchased a bunch for a group of people and everyone was able to adjust it to fit them. The engraving is easy to read and the hands are nice looking but subtle.
3,Gave this sterling silver spinner ring to a young lady that works in my nursing home. She only had to bend it a little to get a perfect feel. When she visits me I see her spinning it around on her finger. I said to her I'm so happy üòä you like your ring. She responded to me I love my ring as much as the person who gave it to me! There is a wonderful inscription inside. I bought a few more.
4,"That ""one little thing"" is... Although advertised as made up of Sterling silver  it is obvious to me  that is not the case. 	The ring is very cute and it may ""contain"" some sterling in the mix  but it is definitely made up of other metals or metal. I only paid a few bucks for it and it is worth keeping. I just hope it does not turn the finger green."
5,"My daughter absolutely loved this ring.  Not only beautiful but meaningful.	However  in less than a week there was a perfect imprint of hands and all in green around her finger.  Very disappointing.  This is not 100% stirling silver. Copper causes the green.  Not sure yet to return or cover in clear polish as she really likes the ring."
6,It‚Äôs a cute ring at first  but turned my daughter‚Äôs finger green by the next day wearing. Definitely not ‚Äústerling silver‚Äù as described! I wish I took pics  when she first started wearing! A month later all the coloring is off and some of the inscription inside. Even after all the coloring came off  her finger still has a tinge of green because she wants to wear.
7,i thought the rings were foing to come in this nice box so i can give them to my girls who lost their father coming up on 2 years. but they came in a plastic bag with no note card saying what its about.

35,This ring garbage ! Gave it to my granddaughter for Christmas and the silver plating has come off  already   I knew for the money it wasn't  the best   but in less then a month its going in the garage!!
36,My granddaughter loved the ring
37,It turned colors after 2 weeks
38,Amazing Ring Same As Shown In Image And Quality Is Amazing
39,It's unique and very pretty
40,I don't remember getting the ring.
41,pretty ring but is not sterling silver turn colors within a week.
42,very upset how cheap this ring turned out to be  and it was sterling silver????
43,So cute. I gave these to 2 teenage granddaughters and copied a poem online to go with them.
44,The ring is very cute and I got it for my Daughter from her son for Christmas! And she loved it until it started turning her finger green!! I have never had sterling silver turn my finger green!! And I wrote the company and asked them about it and it's been 2 weeks now and I haven't heard anything from them!! So I will not be buying anything from them anymore!
45,"Does not come with box like it insinuates in one of the pics. It comes in a little plastic baggie. 	So you have to buy something separate to put it in if you‚Äôre giving it to someone."
46,Not true sterling  turned my finger enough in three hours..and sterling is all I can ware
47,After a week it started to tarnish and turn my daughters finger green. Don‚Äôt waste your money on it
48,Pretty nice. Very low price. My girls all love them.
49,its very delicate and looks good on my hand.  maybe because I have small hands and fingers
50,The only caveat I would attach to this ring is that you probably need to be careful with regard to touching your hair or wearing clothing made of lace when you're wearing it since the thumbs on the ring appear to catch. All in all  however  this is a lovely everyday piece...especially for the price!
